# Machine learning for morphological galaxy classification 

The *"Machine learning for morphological galaxy classification"* is a repository for classifying [Galaxy Zoo 2](GZ2) images into (1) Galaxy and Non-Galaxy, and (2) Galaxy in Spiral, Elliptical, and Odd objects. We used five classification models including Supprot Vector Machine (SVM) and ..... The SVM and classic CNN used the Zernike moments (ZMs) extracted from images, while CNN - transformer and resnet and vgg .... designed base on original images. 

The details of algorithms where explained in [Ghaderi, Alipour, and Safari](paperlink).

This repository includes two python notebooks of the classifiers for galaxy-non-galaxy classification (ntebook name) and galaxies classification (notebook name).
